# rustlings-toy-project

WIP: template for ACM Rustaceans' word-counting toy project

To use the "autograder":

- run `cargo build`
- then, run each integration test you want

ex:

```sh
$ cargo build
...
$ ./02-simple-cli.sh
There are 1363 lines of code					There are 1363 lines of code
There are 0 empty lines						    There are 0 empty lines
0.00% of the lines are empty					0.00% of the lines are empty
Integration test 'simple_cli_bee_movie_test' passed.
```
